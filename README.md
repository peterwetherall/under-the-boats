Browser-based .io multiplayer game prototype (local version)

Under The Boats is a 2D HTML5 canvas-based game in which the player controls a sea monster.

Currently, there is no real objective aside from going around and "eating" randomly occuring boats within the map.

The player's location can be tracked using a mini-map in the top right hand corner and the player can boost their speed periodically by clicking on the monster.

### Future ideas ðŸ’¡

- Implement health loss if the player does not "eat" a boat for a certain period of time
- Using Node.js and Socket.io or another appropriate technology, make the game multiplayer
- Add more interactive elements to the game such as fighting other players or boats with special characteristics
